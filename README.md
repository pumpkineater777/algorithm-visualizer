# algorithm-visualizer

## General idea

In this project I created a visualizer for algorithm DFS that is used a lot in tasks about graph traversals. In this project i focused on creating the most intuitive UI.

## Key features

1. Ability to create any graph and to execute DFS on it.
2. Helpful comments that are guiding you throught many steps of the algorihm
3. Real-time depiction of the DFS route.

## Getting started

I added a video in the project which is showcasing the entire project. 

If you want to run this project, copy this project as Unity project and simply play the SampleScene.
